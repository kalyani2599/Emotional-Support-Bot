Emotional Support Chatbot System Using BlenderBot90M
1. Project Overview
This project aims to build an emotional support chatbot using BlenderBot90M, a large language model (LLM). The chatbot’s goal is to provide empathetic responses to users and offer support for mental health conversations.

2. Multi-Task Training Methodology
To improve the chatbot’s performance, we train it on multiple tasks:

Emotion Recognition: Identifying emotions in the user’s input.
Response Generation: Creating empathetic responses based on the user's emotions.
Dialogue Continuity: Keeping the conversation smooth and coherent.
The model learns these tasks together to help it understand emotions and maintain a good conversation flow.

3. Evaluation Metrics
To measure the chatbot’s performance, we use:

Accuracy and F1 Score:
Accuracy: 1.0
F1 Score: 1.0
BLEU Score (how well responses match human responses):
BLEU: 0.0
ROUGE Score (how much overlap there is with human responses):
ROUGE-1: 0.625, ROUGE-2: 0.33, ROUGE-L: 0.625
BERTScore (how similar the predicted responses are to human responses):
Precision, Recall, F1: 0.9816, 0.9588
These scores show that the chatbot generates relevant, accurate, and emotionally appropriate responses.

4. Prediction Strategy
The chatbot generates responses based on:

Emotion-Aware Generation: It detects emotions like sadness and responds with empathy.
Contextual Awareness: It remembers the conversation history to keep the dialogue consistent.
Adaptive Responses: The model adjusts its responses to offer comfort or encouragement based on the user’s emotional state.
5. Conclusion
This project uses BlenderBot90M to build a chatbot that can effectively support individuals emotionally. The evaluation metrics show that the chatbot performs well in recognizing emotions and generating supportive, contextually relevant responses.
